## Course Information:
The robotics industry is in a period of rapid growth. This course will cover the fundamentals—modeling, perception, planning, and control—that you need to enter this industry and take advantage of the opportunities presented by it. This course will introduce you to modern ways of thinking about robotics that are based on methods of optimization and learning. Consistent with these ways of thinking, this course will place a strong emphasis on computation.
In particular we will cover the following: 

- Configuration Space
- Rigid Body Motions
- Forward Kinamatics
- Velocity kinematics and Statics
- Inverse kinematics
- Simple Algorithm for motion planing
	-sampling based algorithm
-Basic Path finding:BFS and A* algorithms
-Simple Algorthm as gradient Descent  

## Pre-requisites: 
 willing to code in python and in C++. 

## Recommended Text:
